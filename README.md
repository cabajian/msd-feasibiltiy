Initial MSD Feasibility for the K64F MCU

This project uses [Mbed OS 6](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.12/introduction/index.html) in the *bare metal* profile and is not utilizing Mbed OS as an RTOS. Additional APIs can be added on top of this profile for added functonality.

This project will serve as a codebase for initial feasibility testing on the NXP FRDM K64F microcontroller. The sensor types and interfaces determined in [MSD I Preliminary Detailed Design Phase](https://wiki.rit.edu/display/P21009/Preliminary+Detailed+Design) will be tested. These interfaces include I2C, digital GPIO, and Analog-to-Digital conversion.
